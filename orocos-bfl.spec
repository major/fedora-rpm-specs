Summary:    A framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks

# Explanation from upstream for multiple licenses:
# "The technical reason we could not longer use the LGPL license for RTT/BFL
# software was that the LGPL is not compatible with C++ templates, which are
# used extensively in the RTT/BFL libraries. The 'runtime exception' says
# explicitly that using the C++ templates (or any other function) of the RTT
# software does not make your derived work GPL. The derived work may be
# distributed under any license you see fit."
# see http://www.orocos.org/orocos/license
# Automatically converted from old format: GPLv2 with exceptions and LGPLv2+ - review is highly recommended.

%description
The Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) provides an application independent
framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks, i.e., recursive
information processing and estimation algorithms based on Bayes' rule, such as
(Extended) Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, etc.  These algorithms can, for
example, be run on top of the Realtime Services, or be used for estimation in
Kinematics & Dynamics applications.
