# Downstream-only: use uvloop for tests even on Python 3.12+
#
# Upstream has disabled it because uvloop has not released binary wheels
# for Python 3.12 yet, but we use the python3-uvloop package
#
# Related:
#
# Allow testing with uvloop on Python 3.12
# https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg/pull/1182
#
# (The downstream patch is stronger, as it removes the upper bound on the
# Python version for using uvloop entirely.)

# Note that asyncpg/pgproto comes from a git submodule referencing a separate
# project, https://github.com/MagicStack/py-pgproto. However, we do not treat
# it as a bundled dependency because it contains only sources; it has no build
# system and is not designed for separate installation; and it is managed as a
# part of the asyncpg package, as evidenced by the comment “This module is part
# of asyncpg” in the file headers.

%global common_description %{expand:
asyncpg is a database interface library designed specifically for PostgreSQL
and Python/asyncio. asyncpg is an efficient, clean implementation of PostgreSQL
server binary protocol for use with Python’s asyncio framework. You can read
more about asyncpg in an introductory blog post
