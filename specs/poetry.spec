# We don't ship embedded wheels in Fedora and they are being patched out
# from virtualenv (https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-virtualenv/blob/370bb9cf4e/f/rpm-wheels.patch#_110).
# Since poetry touches get_embedded_wheel() our patch breaks it as it
# retuns None instead of wheels.
# This temporary patch returns correct wheels by calling
# get_system_wheels_paths() from virtualenv.
# TODO get rid of this patch by talking to virtualenv and poetry upstream about a better solution.
