%description
TinyXML-2 is a simple, small, efficient, C++ XML parser that can be easily
integrated into other programs. It uses a Document Object Model (DOM), meaning
the XML data is parsed into a C++ objects that can be browsed and manipulated,
and then written to disk or another output stream.

TinyXML-2 doesnâ€™t parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) nor XSLs
(eXtensible Stylesheet Language).

TinyXML-2 uses a similar API to TinyXML-1, But the implementation of the parser
was completely re-written to make it more appropriate for use in a game. It
uses less memory, is faster, and uses far fewer memory allocations.
