Summary:        Python bindings for V-HACD

# The entire source is MIT, except:
#
# BSD-3-Clause:
#   A bundled copy of the header-only V-HACD library appears as
#   src/vhacdx/VHACD.h. We remove it in %%prep in favor of the system library,
#   but since header-only libraries are effectively static libraries,
#   BSD-3-Clause still appears in the licenses of the binary RPMs.
