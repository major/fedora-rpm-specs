%global common_description %{expand:
Use this package if you want to verify that a PyCA cryptography certificate is
valid for a certain hostname or IP address, or if you use pyOpenSSL and donâ€™t
want to be MITMed, or if you want to inspect certificates from either for
service IDs.  service-identity aspires to give you all the tools you need for
verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.  In the
simplest case, this means host name verification.  However, service-identity
implements RFC 6125 fully.}
