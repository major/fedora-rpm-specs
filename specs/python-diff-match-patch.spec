%global _description %{expand:
The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform
the operations required for synchronizing plain text.

1. Diff
 - Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of
   differences.
2. Match
 - Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain
   text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
3. Patch
 - Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply
   patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.

Google's Diff Match and Patch library, packaged for modern Python.}
