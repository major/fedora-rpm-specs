# In 0.23.1, test dependencies are in dev-deps/test.in. Later, they are moved
# to a test dependency group in pyproject.toml. In either case, we must curate
# them: we donâ€™t want benchmarks, coverage analysis, linters, etc, and
# pytest-sphinx, while perhaps potentially useful, is not packaged. See
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#_linters.

BuildRequires:  %{py3_dist sortedcollections}
# The sortedcontainers dependency is mentioned in documentation, but does not
# appear in a doctest that we actually run.
