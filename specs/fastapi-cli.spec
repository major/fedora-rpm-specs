# This package corresponds to two PyPI projects (fastapi-cli-slim, and
# fastapi-cli) co-developed in one repository. Since the two are versioned
# identically and released at the same time, it makes sense to build them from
# a single source package. (The fastapi-slim and fastapi packages are versioned
# and packaged separately.) The two published PyPI sdists differ only in their
# pyproject.toml files: they have different names, and some of the dependencies
# for fastapi-cli-slim belong to an optional extra.

Requires:       fastapi-cli-slim = %{version}-%{release}

# Since requirements-tests.txt contains overly-strict version bounds and many
# unwanted linting/coverage/typechecking/formatting dependencies
# (https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#_linters),
# we just list the few test dependencies we *do* want manually rather than
# trying to patch the requirements file. We preserve upstreamâ€™s lower bounds
# but remove upper bounds, as we must try to make do with what we have.
