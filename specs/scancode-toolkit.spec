# NOTE: Upstream's wheels include the license cache as a Python pickle, so
# let's build that here. Without this file, scancode tries to write the cache
# to site-packages itself which it doesn't have permissions for.
# TODO: Upstream's approach to caching is problematic.
# It treats pickles as a portable data format and tries to write a new cache to
# site-packages if the cache is invalid or does not exist.
# See https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/issues/3497.
# This should be fixed to prefer a user-writable cache directory.
