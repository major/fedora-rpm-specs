%description
cproc is a C11 compiler using QBE as a backend. It is released under the ISC
license.

Some C23 features and GNU C extensions are also implemented.

There is still much to do, but it currently implements most of the language and
is capable of building software including itself, mcpp, gcc 4.7, binutils, and
more.

It was inspired by several other small C compilers including 8cc, c, lacc, and
scc.
