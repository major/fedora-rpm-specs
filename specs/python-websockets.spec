%global _description %{expand:
websockets is a library for developing WebSocket servers and clients in
Python. It implements RFC 6455 with a focus on correctness and simplicity. It
passes the Autobahn Testsuite.

Built on top of Pythonâ€™s asynchronous I/O support introduced in PEP 3156, it
provides an API based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly concurrent
applications.}
