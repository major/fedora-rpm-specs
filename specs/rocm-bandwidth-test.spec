%description
ROCm Bandwidth Test is designed to capture the performance
characteristics of buffer copying and kernel read and write
operations. The benchmark help screen shows various options
for initiating copy, read, and write operations. In
addition to this, you can also query the system topology in
terms of memory pools and their agents.
