%global desc %{expand: \
Numpoly is a generic library for creating, manipulating and evaluating
arrays of polynomials based on `numpy.ndarray` objects.

- Intuitive interface for users experienced with numpy, as the library
  provides a high level of compatibility with the `numpy.ndarray`,
  including fancy indexing, broadcasting, `numpy.dtype`, vectorized
  operations to name a few
- Computationally fast evaluations of lots of functionality inherent
  from numpy
- Vectorized polynomial evaluation
- Support for arbitrary number of dimensions
- Native support for lots of `numpy.<name>` functions using numpyâ€™s
  compatibility layer (which also exists as `numpoly.<name`> equivalents)
- Support for polynomial division through the operators `/`, `%` and
  `divmod`
- Extra polynomial specific attributes exposed on the polynomial
  objects like `poly.exponents`, `poly.coefficients`,
  `poly.indeterminants` etc.
- Polynomial derivation through functions like `numpoly.derivative`,
  `numpoly.gradient`, `numpoly.hessian` etc.
- Decompose polynomial sums into vector of addends using
  `numpoly.decompose`
- Variable substitution through `numpoly.call`}
