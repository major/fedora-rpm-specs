%description
Summarizes key information about statistical objects in tidy tibbles. This
makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently work with
large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each
provide different types of information about a model. tidy() summarizes
information about model components such as coefficients of a regression.
glance() reports information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit
measures like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about individual
observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or influence measures.
