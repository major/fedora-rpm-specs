%global _description %{expand:
Advanced Python Scheduler (APScheduler) is a Python library that lets you
schedule your Python code to be executed later, either just once or
periodically. You can add new jobs or remove old ones on the fly as you
please. If you store your jobs in a database, they will also survive
scheduler restarts and maintain their state. When the scheduler is
restarted, it will then run all the jobs it should have run while it was
offline.}
