# The entire source is Apache-2.0, except that versioneer.py and the
# _version.py it generates are CC0-1.0, not generally allowed for code in
# Fedora, but OK under the exception for existing uses in Fedora prior to
# 2022-08-01. While these are included in the source RPM, we re-generate
# _version.py using the system python-versioneer, which is a later version
# under Unlicense so the resulting _version.py is also Unlicense.

# Update Versioneer and fix config.
# Part of the changes are required even if upstream decides not to
# merge the PR fully (e.g. sticking with the current Versioneer version).
# In that case we could use the system installed Versioneer to recreate
# versioneer.py as well as _version.py which are than Unlicense.
