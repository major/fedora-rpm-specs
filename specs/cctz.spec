%description
CCTZ contains two libraries that cooperate with <chrono> to give C++
programmers all the necessary tools for computing with dates, times, and time
zones in a simple and correct manner. The libraries in CCTZ are:
  * The Civil-Time Library - This is a header-only library that supports
    computing with human-scale time, such as dates (which are represented by
    the cctz::civil_day class).
  * The Time-Zone Library - This library uses the IANA time zone database that
    is installed on the system to convert between absolute time and civil time.
