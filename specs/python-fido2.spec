%global _description\
Provides library functionality for communicating with a FIDO device over USB\
as well as verifying attestation and assertion signatures.\
\
WARNING: This project is in beta. Expect things to change or break at any time!\
\
This library aims to support the FIDO U2F and FIDO 2.0 protocols for\
communicating with a USB authenticator via the Client-to-Authenticator\
Protocol (CTAP 1 and 2). In addition to this low-level device access, classes\
defined in the fido2.client and fido2.server modules implement higher level\
operations which are useful when interfacing with an Authenticator, or when\
implementing a Relying Party.\
\
For usage, see the examples/ directory.
