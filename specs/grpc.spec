# Parameters for third-party sources needed for their .proto files, which
# upstream expects to download at build time.
#
# See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/29254 “[xDS Proto] Enhence gRPC
# buildgen for 3rd party proto compilation” and
# https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/99752b173cfa2fba81dedb482ee4fd74b2a46bb0,
# in which the download mechanism was added.
#
# Check CMakeLists.txt (search for “download_archive”) for a list of these
# third-party sources and the commit hashes used in the grpc release.
#
# Note that we do not treat these additional sources as bundled dependencies,
# since (provably) only the .proto files are used.
#
# In practice, it seems the generated binding code for these protos is not
# re-generated when building this package, so we could get by with creating the
# appropriate directories and touching an empty file within each. We include
# these archives in the source RPM anyway, since they are in some sense part of
# the original sources for the generated proto code.

# This will probably never be separately packaged in Fedora, since upstream can
# only build with Bazel (and Bazel is such a mess of bundled dependencies that
# it is unlikely to every be successfully packaged under the Fedora packaging
# guidelines. Note that the URL is a read-only mirror based on
# https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy, with different commit hashes.

# These three tests all authenticate against the SPIFFE test PKI in
# test/core/tsi/test_creds/spiffe_end2end/, and its CA certificate expired on
# 2026-03-07:
#
#   $ openssl x509 -in test/core/tsi/test_creds/spiffe_end2end/ca.pem \
#         -noout -subject -enddate
#   subject=C=US, ST=VA, O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd, CN=foo.bar.hoo.ca.com
#   notAfter=Mar  7 19:34:46 2026 GMT
#
# It is the only expired certificate in the test tree; the leaf certificates
# it signs are valid until 2035. Every TLS handshake in these tests therefore
# fails certificate verification, so the tests cannot pass no matter what we
# do to the build. This is a time bomb in the 1.75.1 tarball rather than
# anything specific to Fedora.
#
# Upstream has since regenerated the whole credential set (the CA on master
# runs 2026-03-09 to 2027-03-09), but with a new key, so the new ca.pem is not
# a drop-in replacement: backporting it means carrying all 23 files of
# test/core/tsi/test_creds/spiffe_end2end/, and buys only until March 2027,
# when the replacement expires in turn. These tests are therefore simply
# skipped. Re-enable them after a rebase to a release whose bundled SPIFFE CA
# is still valid.

# Ignore SIGPIPE for the test executables. A disposition of SIG_IGN (unlike a
# signal handler) survives exec, so every test below inherits it.
#
# This is needed because c-ares does the actual socket I/O for the DNS
# resolver, and when gRPC installs its own socket callbacks, the c-ares
# compatibility shim writes with writev() rather than send(..., MSG_NOSIGNAL).
# If the peer has already closed the connection, the test is killed by
# SIGPIPE. For example, cancel_ares_query_test dies in
# CancelDuringAresQuery.TestQueryFailsWithDataRemainingInReadBuffer:
#
#   writev () from /lib64/libc.so.6
#   legacycb_asendto () from /lib64/libcares.so.2
#   ares_socket_write () / ares_conn_flush () / ares_send_query_int ()
#   ares_process_fds () from /lib64/libcares.so.2
#   grpc_event_engine::experimental::AresResolver::OnAresBackupPollAlarm ()
#
# Upstream does not hit this because it builds against its own bundled c-ares.
# Ignoring SIGPIPE is the normal expectation for processes doing socket I/O,
# so this only makes the tests behave like a well-behaved gRPC application.
