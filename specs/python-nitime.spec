%global _description %{expand:
Nitime is library of tools and algorithms for the analysis of time-series data
from neuroscience experiments. It contains a implementation of numerical
algorithms for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a
set of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects that
expose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and make common
analysis tasks easy to express with compact and semantically clear code.

Current information can always be found at the nitime website. Questions and
comments can be directed to the mailing list:
http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/nipy-devel.

Documentation is available at http://nipy.org/nitime/documentation.html
