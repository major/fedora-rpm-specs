Name:           unifdef
Version:        2.12
Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        Selectively remove C preprocessor conditionals

# The entire source is BSD-2-Clause, except:
#
# BSD-3-Clause:
#   - unifdef.1
#   - FreeBSD/* (removed in %%prep, not used in the build)
#
# From unifdef.c:
#
#   This code was derived from software contributed to Berkeley by Dave Yost.
#   It was rewritten to support ANSI C by Tony Finch. The original version of
#   unifdef carried the 4-clause BSD copyright licence. None of its code
#   remains in this version (though some of the names remain) so it now carries
#   a more liberal licence.

# We package from the manual release archive on the website rather than from
# the automatic GitHub archive,
#   %%{forgeurl}/archive/unifdef-%%{version}/unifdef-unifdef-%%{version}.tar.gz
# even though the latter has advantages for auditability. Building unifdef
# requires version.h and version.sh at the top level, and producing these
# requires git history. For 2.12, the release archive and GitHub archive were
# manually compared, and no unexpected discrepancies were found.

%description
The unifdef utility selectively processes conditional C preprocessor #if
and #ifdef directives. It removes from a file both the directives and the
additional text that they delimit, while otherwise leaving the file alone.

# Show that we do not use the sources in FreeBSD â€“ even though this does not
