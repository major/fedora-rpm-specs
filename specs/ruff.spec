Name:           ruff
Version:        0.14.5
# The ruff package has a permanent exception to the Updates Policy in Fedora,
# so it can be updated in stable releases across SemVer boundaries (subject to
# good judgement and actual compatibility of any reverse dependencies). See
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Updates_Policy/#_other_packages,
# https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3197. It also has a corresponding exception in
# EPEL, but only in leading branches and only until version 1.0; see
# https://pagure.io/epel/issue/350.
Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        Extremely fast Python linter and code formatter

# The license of the ruff project is MIT, except:
#
# As described in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20222, the README
# lists projects whose rules ruff has (re)implemented but from which ruff does
# not otherwise reuse or adapt source code. We don’t consider those to be
# bundled dependencies, and we don’t consider their licenses to contribute to
# the licenses of the binary RPMs.
#
# Meanwhile, LICENSE documents projects from which parts of ruff are derived,
# e.g. by copying and adapting source code. In general, we can’t always readily
# identify precisely which source files are derived from each of these upstream
# projects, and it doesn’t make sense to treat them as bundled or vendored
# dependencies. However, we do need to account for their licenses.
#
# MIT (same as ruff itself):
#   - autoflake
#   - autotyping
#   - flake8
#   - flake8-eradicate
#   - flake8-pyi
#   - flake8-simplify
#   - isort
#   - pygrep-hooks
#   - pycodestyle
#   - pydocstyle
#   - pyflakes
#   - Pyright
#   - pyupgrade
#   - rome/tools
#   - RustPython
#   - rust-analyzer/text-size
#
# =====
#
# Besides the above projects mentioned in LICENSE, the following vendored,
# forked, or derived code is present, either directly in the ruff source
# archive or as additional sources corresponding to git dependencies.
#
# Apache-2.0 AND MIT:
#   - crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/ is a bundled snapshot of
#     https://github.com/python/typeshed at a commit hash listed in
#     ruff/crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/source_commit.txt; license text
#     is in crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/LICENSE
#
#    Within the typeshed snapshot, the docstring of
#    crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/stdlib/ast.pyi cites the Python-2.0.1
#    license of the ast module from the Python library. We feel that this
#    type-stub file probably doesn’t contain enough of the original Python
#    source for the license to apply. If we’re wrong, then SourceLicense and
#    License should gain a Python-2.0.1 term.
#
# Apache-2.0 OR MIT:
#   - crates/ruff_annotate_snippets/ is a fork of the annotate-snippets crate
#   - salsa, salsa-macros, salsa-macros-rules, Source200
#
# MIT:
#   - book/mermaid.min.js in the vendored salsa snapshot; does not contribute
#     to the licenses of the binary RPMs, since we do not package the book, and
#     it is removed in %%prep to be sure
#   - lsp-types, Source100
#
# =====
#
# A few other source files carry their own licenses but do not fit into the
# above categories.
#
# Apache-2.0:
#   - crates/ruff_server/resources/test/fixtures/tensorflow_test_notebook.ipynb
#     comes from TensorFlow, and some of its content also appears in
#     crates/ruff_server/tests/notebook.rs and in the snapshots
#     crates/ruff_server/tests/snapshots/notebook__changed_notebook.snap and
#     crates/ruff_server/tests/snapshots/notebook__initial_notebook.snap; none
#     of these should contribute to the licenses of the binary RPMs, since they
#     are only for testing
#
# Apache-2.0 OR MIT:
#   - .github/workflows/release.yml (autogenerated by dist,
#     https://github.com/astral-sh/cargo-dist; does not contribute to the
#     licenses of the binary RPMs, since it is only for CI)
#
# MIT:
#   - playground/shared/src/Icons.tsx contains icons from the VS code icon set,
#     https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-icons/; we do not package the
#     in-browser playground, available at https://play.ruff.rs/, so this file
#     does not contribute to the licenses of the binary RPMs

#
# In crates/ruff_annotate_snippets/README.md, upstream writes:
#
#   This is a fork of the [`annotate-snippets` crate]. The principle motivation
#   for this fork, at the time of writing, is [issue #167]. Specifically, we
#   wanted to upgrade our version of `annotate-snippets`, but do so _without_
#   changing our diagnostic message format.
#
#   This copy of `annotate-snippets` is basically identical to upstream, but
#   with an extra `Level::None` variant that permits skipping over a new
#   non-optional header emitted by `annotate-snippets`.
#
#   More generally, it seems plausible that we may want to tweak other aspects
#   of the output format in the future, so it might make sense to stick with
#   our own copy so that we can be masters of our own destiny.

%global common_description %{expand:
An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while
integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), Black, isort,
pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake, and more, all while executing tens or
hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.}
