# These tests had to be fixed for Python 3.14 by adding the event_loop fixture,
# https://github.com/uburuntu/throttler/pull/6, but then pytest-asyncio removed
# that fixture. Itâ€™s not clear exactly how to fix these tests, and they will
# probably just have to remain broken unless and until upstream development
# activity picks up again.
