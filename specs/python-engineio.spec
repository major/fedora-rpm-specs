%global common_description %{expand:
Engine.IO is a lightweight transport protocol that enables real-time
bidirectional event-based communication between clients (typically, though not
always, web browsers) and a server. The official implementations of the client
and server components are written in JavaScript. This package provides Python
implementations of both, each with standard and asyncio variants.}
