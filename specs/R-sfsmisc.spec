%description
Useful utilities ['goodies'] from Seminar fuer Statistik ETH Zurich, some
of which were ported from S-plus in the 1990s. For graphics, have pretty
(Log-scale) axes, an enhanced Tukey-Anscombe plot, combining histogram and
boxplot, 2d-residual plots, a 'tachoPlot()', pretty arrows, etc. For
robustness, have a robust F test and robust range(). For system support,
notably on Linux, provides 'Sys.*()' functions with more access to system
and CPU information. Finally, miscellaneous utilities such as simple
efficient prime numbers, integer codes, Duplicated(), toLatex.numeric() and
is.whole().
