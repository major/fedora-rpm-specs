# The odd combination of an arched package with only noarch binary packages
# makes it easier for us to detect with arch-dependent test failures, since the
# tests will always be run on every platform, and easier for us to skip failing
# tests if necessary, since we can be sure that %%ifarch macros work as
# expected.
#
# Since the package still contains no compiled machine code, we still have no
# debuginfo.

%global _description %{expand:
Pingouin is an open-source statistical package written in Python 3 and based
mostly on Pandas and NumPy. Some of its main features are listed below. For a
full list of available functions, please refer to the API documentation.

  1. ANOVAs: N-ways, repeated measures, mixed, ancova
  2. Pairwise post-hocs tests (parametric and non-parametric) and pairwise
     correlations
  3. Robust, partial, distance and repeated measures correlations
  4. Linear/logistic regression and mediation analysis
  5. Bayes Factors
  6. Multivariate tests
  7. Reliability and consistency
  8. Effect sizes and power analysis
  9. Parametric/bootstrapped confidence intervals around an effect size or a
     correlation coefficient
 10. Circular statistics
 11. Chi-squared tests
 12. Plotting: Bland-Altman plot, Q-Q plot, paired plot, robust correlation…

Pingouin is designed for users who want simple yet exhaustive statistical
functions.

For example, the ttest_ind function of SciPy returns only the T-value and the
p-value. By contrast, the ttest function of Pingouin returns the T-value, the
p-value, the degrees of freedom, the effect size (Cohen’s d), the 95%
confidence intervals of the difference in means, the statistical power and the
Bayes Factor (BF10) of the test.}
