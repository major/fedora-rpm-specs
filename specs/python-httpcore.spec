%description
The HTTP Core package provides a minimal low-level HTTP client, which does
one thing only: Sending HTTP requests. It does not provide any high level
model abstractions over the API, does not handle redirects, multipart uploads,
building authentication headers, transparent HTTP caching, URL parsing, etc.
