# Since requirements-tests.txt contains overly-strict version bounds and
# unwanted linting/coverage/typechecking/formatting dependencies
# (https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#_linters),
# we just list the few test dependencies we *do* want manually rather than
# trying to patch the requirements file. We preserve upstreamâ€™s lower bounds
# but remove upper bounds, as we must try to make do with what we have.
